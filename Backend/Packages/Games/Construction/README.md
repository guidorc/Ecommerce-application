# Construction
Simulation of the Construction board game, a Euro-style game for 2 to 6 players, which is similar to Monopoly. Players operate an earth-moving business with two backhoes, one bulldozer, $100,000 cash, and a $100,000 line of credit. As they move around the board, players try to succeed at jobs which require particular equipment, acquire additional assets, and be the first to amass $1,500,000 in net assets (default).

Install the package Construction.pck.st, then (cmd-do) the following:

Construction start.

As the game progresses the outcome is often increasingly unpredictable and come-from-behind victories can occur at the end.

## Differences ##
This program differs from the actual board game as follows:

- Automatic and interactive board tours
- No limits on equipment quantities
- History of player's progress
- Statistics
- Optional views to assist decision making
- Players automatically informed of doubled state
- Computer is banker, auctioneer, and auditor
- Auditing is continuous
- Rules enforced consistently
